# MMartinMarin tattoo

This project is a portfolio/information website for Martin Marin, my cousin who is a tattoo artist.

I wanted to create something where people could have a good experience even before getting an appointment with him.
For him, health and safety is everything, he is a very artistic but mainly a very simple person. On the website you will see that, simplicity.

You will see his work, his career story told by him and the way he works.

I want that the first thing people see from the website is how much care he gives to the customer and its surroundings.

## UX

1. The main idea of the project is to show the user how the artist works, to give a bit of an insight and to maybe know a bit more about him and his story.

2. On the main page you can see a regular picture, but the idea behind it is for people to see his care when working.
Some people may just see a picture of someone doing a tattoo. Others, like me, see an artist that takes care of his customers by giving them a safe environment. How? You may ask, well, he is wearing face mask and gloves on the background picture. As a customer, this gives me a good and safe feeling.

2. Then we see how long he's being doing this for, also we are again reassured about his standard by seeing a phrase and a logo that attracts people (Highest quality products and gloves logo). Also people's testimonials.

3. As you go along the website, you learn about his story and the way the artist thinks. This will be engaging for the customer and they may feel like they know more of the artist even if they never met. They will see his work in great detail and there will be information about the place with a map view.

## Technologies Used

The languages used were HTML, CSS and JS (by bootstrap.)

I also used Bootstrap for most of the project.


## Testing

1. You go to the website and it will be opened straight away in the home page. On the homepage you can scroll down with ease and the navbar stays on top. Everything is to the point.

2. As you check on the navbar you have all the links to navigate the website. When you go through them, they will change colours (mainly the named ones). If you click the logo, you will always go back to the homepage. I thought it was a good addition, this way you don't anything in the navbar that doesn't have a purpose.

3. As you try to make the screen smaller for the different device, you will see that the homepage changes the layout, the background picture gets smaller, the navbar collapses leaving only the logo and the menu button. The quote disappears, the texts align to the center and the pictures on testimonials also dissapear.

4. When you go to the about page, you will see that the ABOUT link on top stays highlighted to show that you are there. This page is very straight forward and as you reduce/change the device, font and picture will be smaller and eventually the picture will be placed in the bottom of the text.

5. Going forward you have the "my work" page, you will see a carousel with the pictures. Every couple of seconds the picture with change on its own and they all have a quote, you can click the next button, press the arrows on the keyboard or use your finger to slide it on a mobile or tablet.
Like the other segments this is responsive, it reduces the size of the picture and it also the text disappears as the screen gets smaller.

6. Next you have the contact page, you have the contact form, the address of the studio and a map. If you press the name of the studio, it will take you to their instagram page.
As the screen gets small, the map goes to the bottom and the address to the side.
The contact form is not fully functional to send messages but the idea is:
  1. Contact form:
    1. Go to contact pages
    2. Write down your name and surname.
    3. Your email.
    4. The subject to see what kind of enquiry it is and being able to file in eventually.
    5. Submit.

7. The next section in the navbar is the flag, in the main page case will be the Spanish flag, meaning that the website has also a Spanish version. If you press you will go to a website that has the same information and layout as the English version. The only difference is that the flag section has the English flag, which you guessed it, means you can go to the English website.

8. Last but not least, you have the social media logos. By pressing them you go to the main Instagram page and youtube website.

Tried the link in Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox... For Chrome and Firefox it work perfectly fine, there is a bug with Safari that I will keep working on it to fix it eventually.

## Deployment

The project I started doing it in Gitpod and then swapped for Atom as I found it fasted.

To deploy it I cloned my repository to Atom and luckily Atom also works hand in hand with GitHub. Once it was cloned, all I had to do was:

1. going to Git button.

2. Once opened, I pressed Stage All.

3. Wrote down a commit message in the commit message box and pressed Commit to local (which is the branch I created).

4. I go to the GitHub window in Atom and press "Open new pull resquest", which pushes the commit to GitHub.

5. A window opens in GitHub where I Create a Pull request.

6. I merge the pull request with the master branch. Press confirm merge.

7. Once all the information is safely saved, I delete the Local branch.

8. Then I went to Settings.

9. Scrolled to GitHub pages and changed the source to Master branch.

10. The site was published but it showed only the README.md.

11. My mentor explained that I should move index.html to the main folder.
